# preparation hook for sources
# source archive must be recovered here, optionaly reworked, and
# moved to $(SOURCE_ARCHIVE) (the expected path of the source archive for the
# rest of the build)
#
# $(WGS) should be the prefered way to recover archives
# (add checksum against a manifest file).
# use 'make manifest' to generate/update this manifest file.

# more complex case with upstream source rework and rebuilding of the tar
