Description: Extensible Open Source CAx program
 For 3D printing, CNC milling or for the manual assembly of complicated
 constructs one needs a formal specification of the workpiece, i.e.,
 its parts and how these come together. The process to get there is
 called Computer-Aided Design (CAD). The process to transform a CAD
 model into a series of instructions that can be performed on a machine
 is called Computer-Aided Manufacturing (CAM). AstoCAD (FreeCAD soft-fork) can do both, the
 prior yet a bit better than the latter.
 .
 AstoCAD (FreeCAD soft-fork) is an Open Source CAx RAD based on OpenCasCade, Qt and Python.
 It features some key concepts like macro recording, workbenches, ability
 to run as a server and dynamically loadable application extensions and
 it is designed to be platform independent.
 .
 Currently, AstoCAD (FreeCAD soft-fork) can import and display CAD models in IGES, STEP, and
 BRep formats and meshes in STL, BMS, AST and Wavefront OBJ formats.
 Editing and modeling features are currently somewhat limited.
 .
 This is a metapackage of AstoCAD (FreeCAD soft-fork) component packages.
