Description: high-level 3D graphics kit implementing the Open Inventor API
 Coin is an OpenGL-based, retain-mode 3D graphics library that
 implements the Open Inventor 2.1 API. It also includes support for
 VRML97 and 3D audio.  Installing the suggested packages will enable
 extra features:
 .
     libsimage-dev enables loading of image files in SbImage
     libfreetype6 enables use of TrueType fonts
     libopenal0a   enables audio support
     zlib1g and libbz2 enable transparent read of compressed files
